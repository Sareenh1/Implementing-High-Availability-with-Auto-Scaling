# Autoscaling and Load Balancing for CPU Spike Simulation on AWS

This guide provides step-by-step instructions for implementing autoscaling and load balancing for a CPU spike simulation script on AWS. The setup utilizes Amazon EC2 instances, Auto Scaling Groups, an Application Load Balancer, and CloudWatch alarms for monitoring. Follow these steps to deploy the solution:

## Step 1: Create an Amazon Machine Image (AMI)

1. Launch an EC2 instance.
2. Install the necessary dependencies and upload your CPU spike simulation script.
3. Configure the instance to start your script automatically upon boot.
4. Create an AMI from this instance.

## Step 2: Launch Configuration

1. Go to the AWS Management Console.
2. Navigate to EC2 -> Auto Scaling -> Launch Configurations.
3. Create a launch configuration using the AMI created in Step 1.

## Step 3: Auto Scaling Group

1. In the AWS Management Console, go to EC2 -> Auto Scaling -> Auto Scaling Groups.
2. Create an Auto Scaling Group using the launch configuration from Step 2.
3. Configure scaling policies based on CPU utilization (e.g., add instances for high CPU, remove for low CPU).

## Step 4: Load Balancer

1. In the AWS Management Console, go to EC2 -> Load Balancers.
2. Create an Application Load Balancer (ALB).
3. Configure listeners and target groups, adding instances from the Auto Scaling Group to the target group.

## Step 5: Update Security Groups

Ensure that your instances' security groups allow traffic from the load balancer.

## Step 6: Test the Setup

1. Once the Auto Scaling Group is running instances and registered with the load balancer, test by accessing the ALB's DNS name or IP.

## Step 7: Monitoring with CloudWatch Alarms

1. Set up CloudWatch alarms to monitor key metrics (e.g., CPU utilization).
2. Define thresholds for triggering scaling actions based on alarms.

## Note:

- Verify that your script and dependencies are configured correctly for this environment.
- Consider customizing the configuration, adding health checks, setting up alarms, and fine-tuning scaling policies based on specific requirements.
- This guide provides a basic setup; additional customization may be necessary for specific use cases.
