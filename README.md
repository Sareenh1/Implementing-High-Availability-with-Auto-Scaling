#To implement autoscaling and load balancing for the given CPU spike simulation script on AWS, you can use Amazon EC2 instances, Auto Scaling Groups, and an Application Load Balancer. #Here are the steps:

Create an Amazon Machine Image (AMI):

Launch an EC2 instance.
Install the necessary dependencies and upload your script.
Configure the instance to automatically start your script upon boot.
Create an AMI from this instance.
Launch Configuration:

Go to the AWS Management Console.
Navigate to EC2 -> Auto Scaling -> Launch Configurations.
Create a launch configuration using the AMI created in step 1.
Auto Scaling Group:

In the AWS Management Console, go to EC2 -> Auto Scaling -> Auto Scaling Groups.
Create an Auto Scaling Group using the launch configuration from step 2.
Configure scaling policies based on CPU utilization. For example, you can set up a policy to add instances when the CPU utilization is high and remove instances when it's low.
Load Balancer:

In the AWS Management Console, go to EC2 -> Load Balancers.
Create an Application Load Balancer (ALB).
Configure listeners and target groups. Add the instances from the Auto Scaling Group to the target group.
Update Security Groups:

Make sure your instances' security groups allow traffic from the load balancer.
Test the Setup:

Once your Auto Scaling Group is running instances and registered with the load balancer, test the setup by accessing the ALB's DNS name or IP.
Now, when your CPU spike simulation script runs and triggers high CPU utilization, the Auto Scaling Group will automatically scale out by launching additional instances. The load balancer will distribute traffic among the instances.

Note: Ensure that your script and dependencies are configured correctly for this environment. Additionally, consider monitoring and adjusting the Auto Scaling Group settings based on your specific requirements.

Keep in mind that this is a basic setup. Depending on your specific use case, you might need to customize the configuration, add health checks, set up alarms, and fine-tune scaling policies for optimal performance.
