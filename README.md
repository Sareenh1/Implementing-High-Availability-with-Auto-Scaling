# Autoscaling and Load Balancing for CPU Spike Simulation on AWS

## Overview

This guide outlines the steps to implement autoscaling and load balancing for a CPU spike simulation script on Amazon Web Services (AWS) using EC2 instances, Auto Scaling Groups, and an Application Load Balancer (ALB).

## Steps

### 1. Create an Amazon Machine Image (AMI)

- Launch an EC2 instance.
- Install the necessary dependencies and upload your script.
- Configure the instance to automatically start your script upon boot.
- Create an AMI from this instance.

### 2. Launch Configuration

- Go to the AWS Management Console.
- Navigate to **EC2 -> Auto Scaling -> Launch Configurations**.
- Create a launch configuration using the AMI created in step 1.

### 3. Auto Scaling Group

- In the AWS Management Console, go to **EC2 -> Auto Scaling -> Auto Scaling Groups**.
- Create an Auto Scaling Group using the launch configuration from step 2.
- Configure scaling policies based on CPU utilization. For example, set up a policy to add instances when CPU utilization is high and remove instances when it's low.

### 4. Load Balancer

- In the AWS Management Console, go to **EC2 -> Load Balancers**.
- Create an Application Load Balancer (ALB).
- Configure listeners and target groups. Add the instances from the Auto Scaling Group to the target group.

### 5. Update Security Groups

- Ensure that your instances' security groups allow traffic from the load balancer.

### 6. Test the Setup

- Once your Auto Scaling Group is running instances and registered with the load balancer, test the setup by accessing the ALB's DNS name or IP.

### Additional Considerations

- Ensure that your script and dependencies are configured correctly for this environment.
- Consider monitoring and adjusting the Auto Scaling Group settings based on your specific requirements.

## Note

Keep in mind that this is a basic setup. Depending on your specific use case, you might need to customize the configuration, add health checks, set up alarms, and fine-tune scaling policies for optimal performance.
